### VPC ###

# Creating a VPC for the EC2 instance.
# A VPC is a virtual network in AWS, which is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud.
# resource "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
#   cidr_block = var.vpc.cidr_block

#   tags = {
#     Name = var.vpc.name
#   }
# }

### SUBNET ###

# Creating a subnet for the EC2 instance.
# A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
# resource "aws_subnet" "subnet" {
#   vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id

#   cidr_block        = var.subnet.cidr_block
#   availability_zone = var.subnet.availability_zone

#   tags = {
#     Name = var.subnet.name
#   }
# }

### SECURITY GROUP ###

# Creating a security group for the EC2 instance.
# A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
# resource "aws_security_group" "security_group" {
#   name_prefix = var.security_group.name_prefix

#   dynamic "ingress" {
#     for_each = var.security_group.rules
#     content {
#       from_port   = ingress.value.from_port
#       to_port     = ingress.value.to_port
#       protocol    = ingress.value.protocol
#       cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidr_blocks
#     }
#   }
# }

### EC2 INSTANCE ###

# Fetching the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
# An AMI is a template that contains a software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications).
# You use AMIs to launch instances.

# Creating the actual EC2 instance.
# An EC2 instance is a virtual server in AWS.
# The instance is created in the VPC and subnet created above.
# The instance is also created with a security group that allows all traffic.

# [Limitations] #
# Terraform is not meant to be used for deploying applications.
# Terraform is meant to be used for deploying infrastructure.
#
# Usually, tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, etc. are used for deploying applications.
# We believe using tools like that would be a little off the scope of this AGES project.
#
# Therefore, the frontend application and the database must be deployed separately.
# For now, these components must be deployed manually by connecting to the EC2 instance.
# that was created with Terraform through AWS EC2 console.
